## About The Multi-Disciplinary Tuberous Sclerosis Program
The Multi-Disciplinary Tuberous Sclerosis Program at Boston Children's Hospital was started with the belief that children with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) can benefit from care that is specially tailored to their needs. Even though the problems with the brain, heart, kidney and other organs seen in TSC are also found in other diseases, their diagnosis and treatment may be specific to TSC.

The Multi-Disciplinary Tuberous Sclerosis Program at Boston Children's Hospital is a team of pediatric specialists, who are dedicated to providing coordinated care for the TSC patients with multi-system problems. We have expertise in the areas of epilepsy, neurosurgery, neuro-psychology, cardiology, nephrology, ophthalmology, dermatology and genetics.

Our program is directed by a child neurologist, a nurse coordinator and a licensed genetic counselor in the Department of Neurology. We also have an educational consultant who helps support families in their child's education needs.

Patients are seen by specialists with the expertise that is appropriate for their particular symptoms. To learn more about each of the specialists, please see the faculty on this website.
